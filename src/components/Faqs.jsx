      "Users are entitled to retain 80% of the performance results achieved on their trader accounts at the end of each business period. The payout can increase up to 95% with optional add-ons, applicable to both Classic and Plus challenges, provided all account Objectives and Rules are met.",

However, when it comes to trading accounts, there is no limit on the number of accounts you can have as long as they are part of different challenge phases. You can combine Funded trading accounts to reach a maximum capital allocation of $400,000, using one or more accounts. Please make sure to follow the guidelines and terms for each challenge phase to avoid any issues.",

This adjustment ensures that dedicated traders are rewarded for their commitment and consistent performance. However, keep in mind that the registration fee remains non-refundable under any other circumstances. No refunds or replacement accounts will be provided unless the third payout milestone is reached. All fees are considered final upon registration.",
